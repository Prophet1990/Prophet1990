This hackathon aim to provide and link all relevant agro-climatic factors with various food crops farming from land preparation to post harvesting stage in order to ensure efficient use of climate for sustainable food production (food security). This challenge aim to ensure food security in accordance to the alarming climatic condition even as the population keep growing at a geometric progression rate. I look forward to leverage on world known climatic data source and geographical soil content data source. This big database will give farmer opportunity to prepare their farming activities with respect to oncoming climatic condition.
