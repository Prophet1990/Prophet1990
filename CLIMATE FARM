Climate Farm aim to provide and link all relevant agro-climatic factors with various food crops farming from land preparation to post harvesting stage in order to ensure efficient use of climate for sustainable agriculture to ensure food security. This challenge aim to ensure food security in accordance to the alarming climatic condition even as the population keep growing at a geometric progression rate. I look forward to construct a smart farming greenhouse to record relevant agroclimatic data and geographical soil content data for certain food crops to later build a self spaced ditigal tools called Farmeter that will provide farmers with nearer weather condition on their natural farm through given practices that stimulating all same condition . This big database will give farmer opportunity to prepare their farming activities with respect to oncoming climatic condition and definitely increase productivity.
